Gridtools
- remove disclaimer
- remove pycache
- put config in other directory (check data section in setup)
- put one class in one file or just gridtracks in a seperate file
- Aim index docstring typo
- Aim index also returns angle!
- Add list of included functions to functions module, e.g. copy one liner descriptions of functions to headin of script
- Put headings between functions to sort them in a better way
- Look at list join function
- Instead of default VScode look at editor shell variable to use default editor of every system
