Gridtools
- remove disclaimer
- remove pycache
- put config in other directory (check data section in setup)
- put one class in one file or just gridtracks in a seperate file
- Aim index docstring typo
- Aim index also returns angle!
- Add list of included functions to functions module, e.g. copy one liner descriptions of functions to headin of script
- Put headings between functions to sort them in a better way
- Look at list join function
- Instead of default VScode look at editor shell variable to use default editor of every system

Analysis
- Reproduce venv instead environment
- remove trash and .idea from git repo
- Put termcolors as feature in gridtools package to not have them in each folder
- Covdetector documentation is missing
- Covdetector documenation including the temp file etc.
- make plotstyle and termcolors in just one folder
- Remove notebook.md
- Remove trash
- Spatial initiator must go
- hobologger coNverter
- Maybe plotstyle in root? import ..plotstyle?

General Ideas
- Add verbosity levels
